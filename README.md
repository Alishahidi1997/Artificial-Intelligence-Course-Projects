# Artificial-Intelligence-Projects

These are my course projects for AI course. We have 6 projects this semester, and we have carried out four of them so far. 
  * [CA 0](https://github.com/alish9776/Artificial-Intelligence-Projects/tree/master/Assignment%200): for practicing with ``jupyter`` and some python libraries such as ``matplotlib``, ``numpy`` and ``pandas``. 
* [CA 1]( https://github.com/alish9776/Artificial-Intelligence-Projects/tree/master/Assignment%201): Implementing uninformed search such as ``BFS`` and ``IDS``, and informed search ``A*``  for Pac-Man with two agents and three different kinds of food.

* [CA 2]( https://github.com/alish9776/Artificial-Intelligence-Projects/tree/master/Assignment%202): Finding the best possible score that our agent could achieve, for a game with ``minimax`` and ``alpha-beta pruning``  algorithms. 
* [CA 3]( https://github.com/alish9776/Artificial-Intelligence-Projects/tree/master/Assignment%203): Predicting the poet of the hemistichs using ``na√Øve Bayes`` algorithm.
